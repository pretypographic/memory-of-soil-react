# Documentation "Memory of Soil"

## Description
This site serves as the documentation for the artistic project "Memory of Soil". It offers an interactive journey through a gallery of photographs and videos with comments that narrate the story behind work. The site is developed in React and offers convenient navigation thanks to built-in routing.

## Important Note
The project will not function without the `media` folder, which contains the necessary media files. Ensure that it is present in the `src` directory before launching the project.

## How to Launch
- Clone the repository.
- Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`.
- Start the project: `npm start` or `yarn start`.

## Current Tasks
We are actively working on the following improvements:
- Fixing known bugs to enhance the stability of the site.
- Improving the user interface for more comfortable interaction with the content.
